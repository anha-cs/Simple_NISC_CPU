This project is a class final project for CSC 137 - Computer System, 
which demonstrates the phased process of building a
CPU using Logisim.

Initially, we will design each individual component of the
CPU, including the Instruction Fetch Unit, the ALU, the
Register File, the Flags Register, and the Controller. Following
this, we will wire these components together and test them by
executing small assembly language programs. 

After each test, we will not only verify the CPU's operation according to the
previous instruction but also enhance the CPU's design to enable
the execution of new instructions.

This project still has a limit of handling MOVC, MOVF and Branch instructions.
